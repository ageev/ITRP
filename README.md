# ITRP
ITRP was renamed to 4me.com
4me this is a ticketing portal based on ITIL. If you need to create few hundreds of tickets for your local IT guys to patch some old systems - this script (I called it The Machinegun) will allow you to do that.

## Prerequisits 
python (Anaconda is a good "all-inclusive" package)
pip install configparser
